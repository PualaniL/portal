       <p>
        Hello there! My name is Lovell Pualani and I am a current emerging professional in the Quality Assurance program at Year Up! 
        I'm determined to change my career and lifestyle. After spending a few years working various jobs such as physical labor and customer service at retail stores, 
        I have decided to return to school at Seattle Central College to pursue a career as a software developer. I am now seeking opportunities to gain experience and enhance my skills and knowledge in the IT industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a highly motivated professional, I possess a powerful combination of qualities that enable me to excel in leadership roles.
        With the ability to inspire and guide others towards a common goal, while demonstrating empathy and humility, I am a natural leader.
        My persistence enables me to overcome obstacles and keep pushing forward, even when faced with setbacks and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I find great joy in lifting weights, 
            as it allows me to challenge myself physically and mentally while improving my overall fitness. 
            Alongside my dedication to personal well-being, I also prioritize taking care of my family and friends, 
            valuing the bonds we share and ensuring their happiness and well-being as well.
       </p>
